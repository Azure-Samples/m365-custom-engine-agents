# Build Custom Engine Agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot (Microsoft 365 Agents SDK)

TL;DR: If you already have a multi‚Äëagent AI application, you can surface it inside Microsoft 365 Copilot without adding another orchestration layer. Use a thin ‚Äúproxy agent‚Äù built with the [Microsoft 365 Agents SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/Agents) to handle Copilot activities and forward a simple request to your existing backend (in this example, we will use a simple Semantic Kernel multi‚Äëagent workflow that writes and SEO‚Äëoptimizes blog posts). Develop fast and deploy to Azure with the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit for VS Code.

## What are Custom Engine Agents (CEAs)?

Software companies‚Äîdigital natives and ISVs‚Äîare building fully fledged multi‚Äëagent AI applications and want to reach users across many channels. Microsoft 365 Copilot is a popular channel, but it already includes its own orchestration. For AI apps with existing multi‚Äëagent orchestration, adding Copilot‚Äôs orchestration on top can become an unnecessary overlay.

Custom Engine Agents remove that extra layer and keep you in control. Your application remains the ‚Äúengine,‚Äù while the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK provides a light integration layer so your agent becomes a first‚Äëclass citizen in Copilot.

## Reference architecture

High‚Äëlevel flow:

1. Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat ‚Üí user selects your agent and submits a prompt.
2. Azure Bot Service ‚Üí delivers Copilot activities (i.e. user messages) securely to your bot endpoint.
3. Proxy Agent (Microsoft 365 Agents SDK) ‚Üí authenticates, handles activities, and forwards a simple, uniform request to your backend‚Äîno extra orchestration here.
4. Your CEA backend ‚Üí runs your own multi‚Äëagent workflow and returns results for the proxy to relay back to Copilot.

This keeps Copilot integration thin while preserving your orchestration choices.

```


<a id="proxy-agent"></a>
## Implementing the proxy agent

The proxy is a small, channel‚Äëaware layer built with the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK, which:

- Validates/authenticates requests (Microsoft Entra)
- Handles activities (message, typing, membersAdded)
- Normalizes input/outputs for your backend‚Äôs API
- Stays stateless and low‚Äëcomplexity so orchestration remains in your app

With the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK, you respond to activities (message, typing, conversation update, and more) triggered by M365 Copilot. Activity handlers and listeners are provided by the respective SDK:

**Python sample** (located in `/cea-proxy-py`):

- PyPi package: [microsoft-agents-hosting-core](https://pypi.org/project/microsoft-agents-hosting-core/)
- Activities: Subclass `ActivityHandler` with `on_message_activity` listener to retrieve messages sent by the user in Copilot

**Code sample** for `on_message_activity` when receiving a user message:
```python
async def on_message_activity(self, turn_context: TurnContext):
    user_text = turn_context.activity.text or ""
    base_url = os.getenv("BACKEND_BASE_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
    endpoint = f"{base_url.rstrip('/')}/generate-blog"

    try:
        timeout = aiohttp.ClientTimeout(total=120)
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession(timeout=timeout) as session:
            async with session.post(endpoint, json={"prompt": user_text}) as resp:
                if resp.status != 200:
                    err_text = await resp.text()
                    message = f"Request failed ({resp.status}). {err_text[:300]}"
                    activity = MessageFactory.text(message)
                    return await turn_context.send_activity(activity)

                data = await resp.json(content_type=None)
                content = data.get("content") if isinstance(data, dict) else None
                if not content:
                    content = "No content returned from generator."

                activity = MessageFactory.text(content)
                return await turn_context.send_activity(activity)
    except Exception as e:
        activity = MessageFactory.text(f"Error contacting generator: {e}")
        return await turn_context.send_activity(activity)
```

**TypeScript sample** (located in `/cea-proxy-ts`):

- npm package: [@microsoft/agents-hosting](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/agents-hosting)

<a id="backend-semantic-kernel"></a>
## Designing the CEA backend with Semantic Kernel Agents + Azure OpenAI

The backend (`backend/main.py`) is a FastAPI app using Semantic Kernel‚Äôs Azure Responses Agents with Azure OpenAI. It exposes one uniform endpoint consumed by the proxy:

- `POST /generate-blog`
  - Accepts: `{ topic, length }` or `{ prompt }` (free‚Äëform)
  - Returns: `{ content: string }` (final markdown)

Sequence diagram of the internal multi‚Äëagent workflow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Param as ParamExtractionAgent
  participant Writer as BlogWriterAgent
  participant SEO as SEOOptimizerAgent

  Param->>Writer: topic, length
  Writer->>Writer: Generate draft
  Writer->>SEO: Draft article
  SEO-->>Writer: SEO guidance (structured)
  Writer-->>Writer: Finalize with SEO
  Note over Writer: Final markdown content
```

Multi‚Äëagent flow:

1) Parameter Extraction Agent
   - Input: Free‚Äëform prompt
   - Output: JSON with `topic` and `length` (clamped; default 5)
   - Model: Small, low‚Äëtemperature for deterministic structure

2) Blog Writer Agent
   - Input: `topic`, `length`
   - Output: Markdown draft
   - Model: Creative settings for richer content

3) SEO Optimizer Agent
   - Input: The draft
   - Output: Structured JSON (title, meta, slug, headings, revised article, improvements, keywords, links, readability, CTA)
   - The structured SEO output is fed back into the writer for a final pass

Best practices:

- Request/response logging middleware for traceability
- Lenient payload parsing (raw strings or JSON)
- Pydantic validation for robust, typed outputs

## Get started fast with the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit (VS Code)

The Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit extension for VS Code streamlines development and deployment:

1. Scaffolding: Create a custom engine agent project (TypeScript or Python) with adapters, activity handlers, manifest, and config.

> üìù **Note:** By default, when creating a new project the Toolkit assumes that you are building a CEA right within the Agent SDK and it will prompt you for an Azure OpenAI endpoint and key. You can leave those values blank, just don't forget to remove those variables from the yaml files referencing them for deployment.

2. Local debugging: Use the built‚Äëin Playground to run and debug locally‚Äîno tunneling required. Alternatively, choose Debug in Copilot which will setup a local tunnel emulating an Azure Bot, forwarding the request from Copilot to your proxy running locally.

3. Deployment: Click deploy to Azure to provision Azure resources (App Service, Managed Identity, Bot registration) and deploy your proxy agent directly from VS Code. 

> **üìù Note:** This will not deploy the backend.

![VSCode Toolkit Screenshot](.\assets\toolkit.png)

This repo was created from the Toolkit's template, so you can open it in VS Code and immediately benefit from these workflows. Open the the individual CEA folders (i.e. `cea-proxy-py`) in VS Code so that the Toolkit recognizes it as a Custom Engine Agent project.

> üí° **Tip:** The Toolkit can also generate the Copilot‚Äëaware manifest and zip packages, reducing manual wiring and schema/version issues. To do so, just run one of the Debug modes (i.e. local) and find the manifest under `cea-proxy-xx/appPackage/build`

<a id="manifest-essentials"></a>
## Make it Copilot‚Äëready: Manifest essentials

The M365 Agent Toolkit Extension creates a manifest file with the correct attributes for you. To better understand what is needed for a Custom Engine Agent to show up as a Copilot Agent, here are the details.

The CEA is declared in `manifest.json` via `copilotAgents.customEngineAgents` pointing to your bot ID:

- Files: `cea-proxy-ts/appPackage/manifest.json`, `cea-proxy-py/appPackage/manifest.json`
- Highlights:
  - `copilotAgents.customEngineAgents`: `{ "type": "bot", "id": "<BOT_ID>" }`
  - `bots.scopes` include `copilot` and `personal` (personal scope also makes the Agent available as a Teams Bot)
  - Optional `commandLists` provide suggested prompts in the Copilot UI

This is the crucial link telling Copilot how to route to your agent via Azure Bot Service.

> üí° **Tip:** Using the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit VS Code extension will take care of creating the necessary attributes and filling in the Bot ID.

If you want to publish your Copilot Agent to your organization, use the appPackage ZIP file which is built by the VSCode extension and upload it for your organization through Microsoft Teams like this:

<a id="when-to-use"></a>
## When to use this pattern

- You already have a multi‚Äëagent AI application and want to surface it inside Copilot without re‚Äëimplementing orchestration
- You want to seperate you agentic AI backend from the middleware publishing to various UX channels
- You need strict control over agentic orchestration, prompts, tools, and model selection (Azure OpenAI, custom models, or both)
- You want multi‚Äëchannel reuse (Copilot, Teams, web, etc.) with a single engine


<a id="faqs"></a>
## FAQs

Q: What‚Äôs the difference between custom engine agents and declarative agents?

A: Declarative agents rely on Copilot‚Äôs orchestration (instructions, knowledge, actions). Custom engine agents bring your own orchestrator/models, using the Agents SDK only as the channel and activity layer.

Q: Do I need Azure Bot Service?

A: Yes. The Microsoft 365 Agents SDK uses Azure Bot Service to handle channel connectivity between Copilot and your agent endpoint.

Q: Can I use other orchestrators like LangChain?

A: Yes. The SDK is orchestrator‚Äëagnostic. This repo uses Semantic Kernel, but you can plug in LangChain, Azure AI Foundry Agents, or your own engine.

Q: Does this support Teams as well?

A: Yes. The proxy agent can be surfaced across channels (Copilot, Teams, web, etc.), reusing the same backend engine.
